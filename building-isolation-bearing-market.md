<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Building Isolation Bearing Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Elastomeric Bearings</li><li>Sliding Bearings</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Building Isolation Bearing Market consists primarily of two types: elastomeric bearings and sliding bearings. Elastomeric bearings, made from layers of rubber and reinforced materials, absorb vibrations and allow for flexibility, making them suitable for earthquake-resistant structures. Sliding bearings, on the other hand, utilize a low-friction surface to enable lateral movement, reducing stress on buildings during seismic activity. Both types enhance structural integrity, providing critical support in mitigating damage during natural events and improving overall safety.</p></p>
