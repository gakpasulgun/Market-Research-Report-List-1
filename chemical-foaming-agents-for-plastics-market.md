<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Chemical Foaming Agents for Plastics Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Endothermic Foaming Agent</li><li>Compound Foaming Agent</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Chemical foaming agents (CFAs) for plastics are categorized into two main types: endothermic foaming agents and compound foaming agents. Endothermic foaming agents absorb heat during the decomposition process, releasing gases that create foam when heated, ideal for applications requiring uniform cell structures. Conversely, compound foaming agents consist of a combination of different chemicals that not only generate gas but may also modify material properties. Both types are essential for enhancing the lightness, insulation, and mechanical properties of plastic products.</p></p>
